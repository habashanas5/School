# I created a small school project featuring separate tables for teachers, subjects, and students, along with a table that links each student to their subject and teacher.
# This project was developed using ASP.NET MVC, API, database (SQL Server Management Studio), and Identity for user authentication functionalities including login, register, logout, profile management, adding roles, deleting roles, adding users, deleting users,JWT, and authorization.
